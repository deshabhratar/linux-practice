📘 Project 1 – Linux & Bash Basics (Learning Notes)

🧠 What this project is about

This project is not a big script or automation.

This is where I:
	•	Got comfortable with the Linux terminal
	•	Learned how Linux folders & files actually work
	•	Understood how commands behave
	•	Built confidence before moving to automation

This project is mainly foundation learning.

🛠️ What I practiced (in simple words)

1️⃣ Navigating the Linux file system

I learned how to move around folders in Linux.

Commands used:

pwd
cd
ls

What they do:
	•	pwd → shows where I am currently
	•	cd → moves into a directory
	•	ls → lists files and folders

Why this matters:
If you don’t know where you are in Linux, nothing else makes sense.

⸻

2️⃣ Creating folders and files

I practiced creating my own workspace.

Commands used:

mkdir
touch
nano

What they do:
	•	mkdir → creates a folder
	•	touch → creates an empty file
	•	nano → opens a simple text editor

Why this matters:
Everything in Linux is a file or folder.
If you can create and edit them, you can build anything.

⸻

3️⃣ Understanding Linux commands (not memorizing)

I learned that:
	•	Linux commands are very strict
	•	One wrong character = error
	•	Linux does exactly what you tell it to do

Example:

ls logs/system_health.log

If the path is wrong → Linux will not guess.

Lesson learned:
Linux is predictable, not smart.
That’s actually a good thing.

⸻

4️⃣ Basic Bash scripting concepts (mentally)

Even before writing scripts, I understood:
	•	Commands give output
	•	Output can be stored in variables
	•	Scripts run top to bottom
	•	Each script runs in its own shell


🧩 Key takeaways from Project 1
	•	Linux is not scary once you slow down
	•	Errors are usually typos or wrong paths
	•	Understanding commands > memorizing commands
	•	Confidence comes from repetition, not theory

⸻

🚀 Why this project exists

This project exists to show:
	•	I didn’t jump straight into automation
	•	I built a strong Linux foundation
	•	I understand what I type in the terminal

Without this project, the next ones would not make sense.

⸻

📌 Final note to future me

If you ever feel stuck again:
	•	Slow down
	•	Read the error
	•	Check the path
	•	Use ls and pwd

Linux always tells the truth.
